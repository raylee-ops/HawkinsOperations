## Types of Contributions

We welcome the following contributions:

### ✅ Accepted Contributions

---

## Before You Contribute

### Read These First

1. [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - Expected behavior
2. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) - Reporting security issues
3. [PROOF_PACK/EVIDENCE_CHECKLIST.md](PROOF_PACK/EVIDENCE_CHECKLIST.md) - Sanitization requirements

### Environment Setup

**Required:**
- Git
- PowerShell (for verification scripts)
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)

**Optional:**
- Python (for future automation scripts)
- Bash/WSL (for Linux-based verification)

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/HawkinsOperations.git
cd HawkinsOperations
git remote add upstream https://github.com/raylee-ops/HawkinsOperations.git
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-sigma-rule-lateral-movement
```

**Branch naming:**
- `feature/` - New detection rules or playbooks
- `docs/` - Documentation improvements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes

### 3. Make Changes

Follow the appropriate guidelines:
- [Detection Rule Guidelines](#detection-rule-guidelines)
- [IR Playbook Guidelines](#incident-response-playbook-guidelines)

### 4. Test Locally

**Verify counts:**
```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File ".\\scripts\\verify\\verify-counts.ps1"
```

**Build Wazuh bundle (if applicable):**
```powershell
.\scripts\build-wazuh-bundle.ps1
```

**Check for sanitization issues:**
```powershell
# Scan for real IPs
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.md,*.yml,*.xml | Select-String -Pattern "\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b" | Where-Object { $_.Line -notmatch "10\.|192\.168\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])\." }
```

### 5. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: Sigma rule for detecting lateral movement via WMI"
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

**Types:**
- `Add:` - New detection rule, playbook, or feature
- `Update:` - Modify existing content
- `Fix:` - Bug fix or correction
- `Docs:` - Documentation only
- `Refactor:` - Code reorganization

### 6. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/add-sigma-rule-lateral-movement
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Detection Rule Guidelines

### Sigma Rules

**Location:** `detection-rules/sigma/<tactic>/`

**Format:**
```yaml
title: Descriptive Rule Title
id: unique-uuid-here
status: stable
description: What this rule detects
references:
    - https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T####/
author: Your Name
date: YYYY/MM/DD
modified: YYYY/MM/DD
tags:
    - attack.<tactic>
    - attack.t####
logsource:
    category: process_creation
    product: windows
detection:
    selection:
        # Detection logic here
    condition: selection
falsepositives:
    - Known legitimate scenarios
level: high  # or critical, medium, low
```

**Requirements:**
- Must include MITRE ATT&CK technique tags
- Must document false positives
- Must be organized into correct tactic folder
- Must use valid Sigma YAML syntax

### Splunk Rules

**Location:** `detection-rules/splunk/`

**Format:**
```spl
# ========================================
# Rule Name
# MITRE: T####
# ========================================

index=windows EventCode=1
| where condition
| stats count by field1, field2
| where count > threshold
```

**Requirements:**
- Include MITRE ATT&CK technique comment
- Use proper SPL syntax
- Include comments explaining logic
- Group by MITRE tactic in files

### Wazuh Rules

**Location:** `detection-rules/wazuh/rules/`

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows the style guidelines
- [ ] All files are sanitized (no real IPs, credentials, PII)
- [ ] Verification scripts pass (`pwsh -NoProfile -File ".\\scripts\\verify\\verify-counts.ps1"`)
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive
- [ ] Changes are focused (one logical change per PR)

### PR Checklist

When you create a PR, fill out the template:

```markdown
## Description

- [ ] Ran verification script
- [ ] Built Wazuh bundle (if applicable)
- [ ] Checked for sanitization issues

## Checklist
- [ ] Followed contributing guidelines
- [ ] No sensitive data included
- [ ] MITRE ATT&CK tags added
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
```

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks:** CI/CD pipeline runs automatically
   - Counts all detection rules
   - Builds Wazuh bundle
   - Verifies file structure
2. **Manual Review:** Maintainer reviews for:
   - Detection logic quality
   - False positive analysis
   - Documentation completeness
   - Sanitization compliance
3. **Feedback:** Address any requested changes
4. **Merge:** Once approved, PR is merged to `main`

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/verify.yml`

**On Pull Request:**
- ✅ Counts detection rules across all platforms
- ✅ Generates verification report
- ✅ Builds Wazuh bundle
- ✅ Uploads artifacts
- ❌ Does NOT auto-commit (PR stays clean)

**On Main Branch Push:**
- ✅ Same as above, plus:
- ✅ Auto-updates `PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md`
- ✅ Commits updated counts back to `main`

### Skipping CI

If you need to skip CI (e.g., documentation-only changes):

```bash
git commit -m "Docs: Update README [skip ci]"
```

**Note:** Use sparingly - verification is fast and ensures quality.
