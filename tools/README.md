# Tools

`tools/` is intentionally narrow in this repository.

## Current Scope

- `migration-tools/` shared migration utilities and legacy migration references

## Notes

- Non-shared security automation mapping content lives under `detection-rules/mappings/`.
- Detection and portfolio verification automation lives under `scripts/`.
