## Questions & Clarifications

**If you encounter issues or have questions while using these runbooks**:

1. **Check this document first** - Is it a known assumption or placeholder?
2. **Verify environment** - Is the system configured as expected?
3. **Test in safe environment** - If unsure, test on MINT-3 before production systems
4. **Document deviations** - Update runbooks and this file with your specific findings
5. **Engage community** - Wazuh community, r/netsec, r/cybersecurity for specific questions

**Common Issues**:
- "Command not found" → Tool not installed, see Tool Availability section
- "Rule ID doesn't match" → Wazuh version difference, verify actual rule IDs
- "Can't access system" → Check IPs, firewall rules, services running
- "Logs not in Wazuh" → Check agent status, ossec.conf, firewall between agent and manager

---

**Remember**: These runbooks are living documents. As HawkinsOps evolves, keep them updated. Every real incident is an opportunity to refine and improve your procedures. Good luck, and happy hunting!
