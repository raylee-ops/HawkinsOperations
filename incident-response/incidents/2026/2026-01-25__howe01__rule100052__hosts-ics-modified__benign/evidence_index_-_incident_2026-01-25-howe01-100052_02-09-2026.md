## Chronological Investigation Flow

For hiring managers reviewing this incident, here's how evidence was collected in sequence:

1. **Overview (16:32)** → Analyst checks global dashboard for context
2. **Filter to High Severity (16:36)** → Narrows focus to Level 12+ alerts
3. **Agent-Specific View (16:37)** → Confirms HOWE01 is sole affected system
4. **Event Details (16:38)** → Identifies Rule 100052 and file path
5. **Local Validation (16:41)** → **CRITICAL STEP** - PowerShell reveals BENIGN file contents
6. **Deep Telemetry (16:44)** → Reviews full event JSON for completeness
7. **Evidence Redundancy (16:44-16:45)** → Captures duplicate views for chain of custody
8. **Filter Export (16:46)** → Documents search criteria for audit trail

This sequence demonstrates:
- Methodical triage following the funnel approach (broad → narrow)
- Proactive evidence preservation
- Critical thinking to validate alerts with local inspection
- Thoroughness in documentation

## Key Evidence for Verdict

**The BENIGN classification rests primarily on:**

**PRIMARY:** `05_powershell_validation_hosts_ics_content.png`
- Shows Microsoft copyright
- Confirms auto-generated ICS file
- Displays benign IP mapping content

**SUPPORTING:** `02_threat_hunting_level12_filter.png` + `03_threat_hunting_howe01_agent.png`
- Single, isolated event
- No lateral movement
- No authentication anomalies

**CONTEXT:** `04_events_table_rule100052.png` + `06_event_detail_json_full.png`
- Rule 100052 correctly detected file modification
- Rich telemetry captured for analysis

---

## Evidence Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive coverage (SIEM + local validation)
- Chronological capture sequence preserved
- Critical proof captured (PowerShell validation)
- Redundant captures ensure nothing lost

**Potential Improvements:**
- Could have captured Wazuh rule definition (Rule 100052 XML)
- Could have included network timeline (was ICS service recently enabled?)
- Could have captured Process Monitor logs showing which process modified file

**Overall Grade:** A- (Excellent for triage/investigation, room for advanced forensics)
