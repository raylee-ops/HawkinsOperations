# PHASE 5 Deferred External Profile Execution Note

## Summary

- Created `docs/deferred/PHASE_5_EXTERNAL_PROFILE.md`.
- Preserved the available Phase 5 text verbatim in that file.
- Added a clearly marked `DEFERRED` checklist for future external execution.

## Why This Exists

Phase 5 is explicitly documentation-only in this run. The purpose is to preserve external profile work instructions without executing LinkedIn/GitHub/resume/external-system changes from this repository workflow.

## Scope Guardrails Applied

- No LinkedIn edits performed.
- No GitHub profile edits performed.
- No resume content edits performed.
- No external systems accessed or changed.
