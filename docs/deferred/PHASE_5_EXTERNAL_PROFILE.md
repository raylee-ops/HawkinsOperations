# PHASE 5 EXTERNAL PROFILE (DEFERRED)

This phase is documentation only; no external profile edits performed.

## Verbatim Phase 5 Tasks (Preserved)

```text
#### PHASE 5: LinkedIn Optimization

* **LinkedIn upgrades deferred to next prompt.**
```

```text
Phase 5 — Deferred External Profile Work
Create a repo doc that preserves the Phase 5 tasks from proxmox.txt (verbatim) without executing them: docs/deferred/PHASE_5_EXTERNAL_PROFILE.md
Gate: this phase produces documentation only.
DoD:
Deferred doc exists
No external edits performed in this run
```

## DEFERRED Checklist (Future Execution)

- [ ] DEFERRED: Confirm external profile execution scope from proxmox source before any action.
- [ ] DEFERRED: Perform LinkedIn optimization tasks externally (not in this repo).
- [ ] DEFERRED: Record externally executed changes in a new follow-up evidence run.
- [ ] DEFERRED: Re-validate that no secrets/internal identifiers are introduced into repo artifacts.
