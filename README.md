## What this repo is (in one breath)
A security operations portfolio repository focused on verifiable detection content (Sigma, Splunk, Wazuh), structured IR playbooks, and reproducible artifacts you can validate locally or via CI.
If a claim cannot be verified, it does not belong here.

## Choose your path (pick one)

| You are... | Start here | What you can validate fast |
|---|---|---|
| Recruiter / Hiring Manager | [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md) | Proof lane + sample artifacts in minutes |
| Technical Reviewer | [`PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md`](PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md) | Live counts + exact locations |
| Detection Engineer | [`detection-rules/INDEX.md`](detection-rules/INDEX.md) | Rule structure across Sigma/Splunk/Wazuh |
| Incident Responder | [`incident-response/INDEX.md`](incident-response/INDEX.md) | Playbook catalog + consistent framework |
| Portfolio Reviewer | [`PROOF_PACK/PROOF_INDEX.md`](PROOF_PACK/PROOF_INDEX.md) | Curated reviewer lane |
| Migration proof trail | [`projects/migration-rh/README.md`](projects/migration-rh/README.md) | Linked proof + verification commands |

## Current verified inventory (generated from repo content)
Source of truth: [`PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md`](PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md)

### Detection rules
| Platform | Count | Location |
|---|---:|---|
| Sigma (YAML) | 105 rules | `detection-rules/sigma/` |
| Splunk (SPL) | 8 queries | `detection-rules/splunk/` |
| Wazuh (XML) | 25 files / 29 rule blocks | `detection-rules/wazuh/rules/` |

### Incident response
| Type | Count | Location |
|---|---:|---|
| IR Playbooks (`IR-*.md`) | 10 playbooks | `incident-response/playbooks/` |

Why two Wazuh counts: files and rule blocks are different when some XML modules contain multiple `<rule id=...>` blocks.

---

## 90-second proof
1. Open [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md) for the 5-minute validation path.
2. Check [`PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md`](PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md) for current counts.
3. Inspect 2-3 artifacts in `PROOF_PACK/SAMPLES/` via [`PROOF_PACK/PROOF_INDEX.md`](PROOF_PACK/PROOF_INDEX.md).

---

## Quick verification (local, reproducible)
Run from repo root (PowerShell):

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File ".\scripts\verify\verify-counts.ps1"
pwsh -NoProfile -File ".\scripts\verify\generate-verified-counts.ps1" -OutFile ".\PROOF_PACK\VERIFIED_COUNTS.md"
pwsh -NoProfile -File ".\scripts\build-wazuh-bundle.ps1"
```

Expected artifacts:
- `PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md`
- `dist/wazuh/local_rules.xml`

## Repository map

| Area | What it contains | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| `PROOF_PACK/` | curated artifacts + evidence lane | reviewable proof path for interviews |
| `detection-rules/` | Sigma/Splunk/Wazuh + mappings | multi-platform detection engineering |
| `incident-response/` | playbooks + templates + index | consistent IR execution model |
| `threat-hunting/` | hunt matrices + hypothesis notes | structured hunting practice |
| `scripts/` | verification + bundle builders | reproducibility + deployable artifacts |
| `projects/` | project subtrees + entrypoints | proof trails for larger workstreams |

## How content flows (repo -> proof -> deploy)

```text
detection-rules/*                incident-response/*
      |                                 |
      |-- verify-counts.ps1             |-- IR-*.md (counted)
      |
      |-- generate-verified-counts.ps1  -> PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md
      |
      '-- build-wazuh-bundle.ps1        -> dist/wazuh/local_rules.xml
```

This maps to the documented Wazuh deployment flow: modules -> bundle -> `/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml` -> restart manager.
