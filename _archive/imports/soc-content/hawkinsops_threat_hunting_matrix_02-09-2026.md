## Hunt Methodology

### 1. Hypothesis Development
- Based on threat intelligence
- Environmental context
- MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Recent security events

### 2. Data Collection
- Identify required log sources
- Aggregate relevant data
- Ensure data quality and completeness
- Consider time windows

### 3. Query Execution
- Run hunt queries
- Document findings
- Iterate and refine
- Note false positives

### 4. Analysis
- Investigate anomalies
- Correlate across data sources
- Timeline analysis
- Attribution assessment

### 5. Reporting
- Document findings
- Provide evidence
- Recommend actions
- Update hunt queries

---

## Best Practices

### Before Hunting
- [ ] Understand normal baseline behavior
- [ ] Review recent threat intelligence
- [ ] Ensure log sources are available
- [ ] Prepare analysis tools
- [ ] Define success criteria

### During Hunting
- [ ] Document all queries executed
- [ ] Track false positives
- [ ] Maintain chain of custody
- [ ] Collaborate with team
- [ ] Take detailed notes

### After Hunting
- [ ] Document findings
- [ ] Create detection rules from findings
- [ ] Share IOCs with team
- [ ] Update runbooks
- [ ] Schedule follow-up hunts

## Hunt Cadence

| Hunt Type | Frequency | Priority |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Credential Access | Weekly | High |
| Lateral Movement | Weekly | High |
| Persistence | Bi-weekly | Medium |
| Execution | Bi-weekly | Medium |
| Linux Hunts | Bi-weekly | Medium-High |
| Ad-hoc (Intel-driven) | As needed | Variable |

---

## Tools Required

### Windows Hunting
- PowerShell
- Sysmon logs
- Windows Event Logs
- Sysinternals Suite
- SIEM access

### Linux Hunting
- Bash shell access
- Auditd logs
- System logs
- rkhunter/chkrootkit
- Network analysis tools

---

## Integration with SOC Workflow

1. **Scheduled Hunts:** Run according to cadence
2. **Intel-Driven Hunts:** Respond to new threat intel
3. **Incident-Triggered:** Hunt after confirmed incident
4. **Tool Testing:** Validate new detection rules

---

## Metrics

Track these metrics to measure hunting effectiveness:

- **Total hunts conducted**
- **Findings identified**
- **True positives vs. false positives**
- **Time to detect (TTD) improvement**
- **Detection rules created**
- **Incidents prevented**
