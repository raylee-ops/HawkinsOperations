## Headline
SOC Analyst (T1/T2) candidate focused on detection engineering and security automation.

## Summary
- Build and validate deployable detections across Sigma, Wazuh, and Splunk with reproducible verification workflows and proof artifacts.
- Maintain evidence-first quality controls using verified counts, CI-aligned checks, ATT&CK mapping, and lab validation.

## Skills
- Detection: Sigma, Wazuh rule authoring, Splunk SPL
- Tooling: PowerShell, Python, Git, GitHub Actions
- Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK, SOC triage workflow, incident response fundamentals
- Lab/Validation: Proxmox, Windows/Linux telemetry generation, reproducible test runs

## Projects
### HawkinsOperations (Primary Portfolio Repo)
- Built and maintain a detection and response library with verified inventory: 105 Sigma rules, 29 Wazuh rule blocks (25 XML files), 8 Splunk detections, and 10 IR playbooks.
- Implemented proof-first validation workflow (scripts + documentation + CI alignment) so reviewers can reproduce claims directly from repo artifacts.

### SOC Triage Simulator
- Built an interactive triage workflow artifact to practice investigation steps, evidence review, and analyst decision flow.
- Added repeatable drill structure and checklists to demonstrate process discipline, not one-off screenshots.

### Home Lab Validation Environment
- Built a Proxmox-based validation lab with Wazuh and Splunk components to test detection behavior before publishing artifacts.
- Use lab runs to validate telemetry assumptions and improve signal quality in portfolio content.

## Additional
- “Eligible to obtain clearance; willing to pursue sponsorship.”
