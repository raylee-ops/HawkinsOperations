## 90-Second Validation Path

Follow these 5 steps to verify claims:

### Step 1: Overview (15 seconds)
**File:** [README.md](README.md)

**What you'll see:**
- Quick navigation table for different audiences
- Platform overview (Sigma, Splunk, Wazuh)
- Clear verification instructions

**Key takeaway:** Well-organized, professional portfolio structure

---

### Step 2: Verified Counts (15 seconds)
**File:** [PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md](PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md)

**What you'll see:**
- Actual detection counts across all platforms
- Auto-generated by GitHub Actions (not manually edited)
- Timestamp showing last verification

**Key takeaway:** 100+ Sigma rules, Wazuh deployment bundle, structured IR playbooks - all verifiable

---

### Step 3: Sample Quality (30 seconds)
**File:** [PROOF_PACK/SAMPLES/README.md](PROOF_PACK/SAMPLES/README.md)

**What you'll see:**
- Real repository artifacts (not synthetic examples)
- Detailed explanations of detection logic
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mappings
- Interview talking points provided

**Key takeaway:** Production-grade content with technical depth

---

### Step 4: Architecture Understanding (20 seconds)
**File:** [PROOF_PACK/ARCHITECTURE.md](PROOF_PACK/ARCHITECTURE.md)

**What you'll see:**
- SOC detection platform coverage
- Incident response framework (7-step process)
- Repository → Production deployment flow
- Tactic coverage matrix

**Key takeaway:** Demonstrates end-to-end SOC operations knowledge

---

### Step 5: Deployment Capability (10 seconds)
**File:** [docs/wazuh/DEPLOYMENT_REALITY.md](docs/wazuh/DEPLOYMENT_REALITY.md)

**What you'll see:**
- PowerShell build script for Windows
- Bash build script for Linux
- Actual deployment commands for Wazuh manager
- Verification steps

**Key takeaway:** Can build and deploy rules to production SIEM

## For Technical Reviewers

Want to verify claims yourself? Here's how:

### Quick Verification (30 seconds)

Run the verification script from repo root:

```powershell
.\\_verify_counts.ps1
```

**Output:**
```
======================================
HawkinsOps Detection Content Counts
======================================

Sigma (.yml files):       105
Splunk (.spl files):      8
Wazuh XML files:          25
Wazuh <rule id=> blocks:  29
IR Playbooks (.md files): 12

======================================
```

**Compare with:** [PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md](PROOF_PACK/VERIFIED_COUNTS.md) should match

---

### Build Production Artifact (1 minute)

Test the Wazuh bundle build process:

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
.\scripts\build-wazuh-bundle.ps1
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Wrote bundle: C:\...\dist\wazuh\local_rules.xml

Next on your Wazuh manager:
  sudo cp "..." /var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml
  sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

**Verify:**
```powershell
Get-Item dist\wazuh\local_rules.xml | Select-Object Name, Length
```

**Expected:** ~51KB file containing concatenated XML rules

**What this proves:** Rules are production-deployable, not just theoretical YAML
