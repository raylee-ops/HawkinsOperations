## Platform Breakdown

### Sigma Rules (YAML)
- **Format:** Platform-agnostic detection logic in YAML
- **Organization:** Grouped by MITRE ATT&CK tactics
- **Use Case:** Convert to any SIEM (Splunk, Elastic, QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel)
- **Tactics Covered:** credential-access, defense-evasion, discovery, execution, exfiltration, impact, lateral-movement, persistence, privilege-escalation

### Splunk Queries (SPL)
- **Format:** Splunk Search Processing Language
- **Organization:** Multi-query files grouped by MITRE ATT&CK tactics
- **Use Case:** Production-ready Splunk searches
- **Features:** Optimized filtering, whitelisting, aggregation

### Wazuh Rules (XML)
- **Format:** Wazuh XML rule modules
- **Organization:** Individual rule files (wazuh-NNN-*.xml)
- **Use Case:** Open-source SIEM deployment
- **Deployment:** Build via `scripts/build-wazuh-bundle.ps1`
- **Note:** Some XML files contain multiple `<rule id="">` blocks

### IR Playbooks (Markdown)
- **Format:** Structured markdown playbooks
- **Framework:** 7-step incident response process
- **Phases:** Detection → Triage (5m) → Investigation (30m) → Containment (15m) → Eradication → Recovery → Documentation
- **Features:** Time-boxed, actionable PowerShell commands, MITRE ATT&CK mapping

## Deployment Ready

### Wazuh Bundle Build

Build a single deployable Wazuh rules file:

``powershell
.\scripts\build-wazuh-bundle.ps1
``

Output: `dist/wazuh/local_rules.xml`

Deploy to Wazuh manager:

``bash
sudo cp dist/wazuh/local_rules.xml /var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
``

See `docs/wazuh/DEPLOYMENT_REALITY.md` for complete deployment instructions.
