SUMMARY
- Build and validate deployable detections across Sigma, Wazuh, and Splunk with reproducible verification workflows and proof artifacts.
- Maintain evidence-first quality controls using verified counts, CI-aligned checks, ATT&CK mapping, and lab validation.

SKILLS
- Detection: Sigma, Wazuh rule authoring, Splunk SPL
- Tooling: PowerShell, Python, Git, GitHub Actions
- Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK, SOC triage workflow, incident response fundamentals
- Lab/Validation: Proxmox, Windows/Linux telemetry generation, reproducible test runs

EXPERIENCE / PROJECTS
- HawkinsOperations (Primary Portfolio Repo)
  - Built and maintain a detection and response library with verified inventory:
    105 Sigma rules, 29 Wazuh rule blocks (25 XML files), 8 Splunk detections,
    and 10 IR playbooks.
  - Implemented proof-first validation workflow so reviewers can reproduce claims
    directly from repository artifacts.

- SOC Triage Simulator
  - Built an interactive triage workflow artifact to practice investigation steps,
    evidence review, and analyst decision flow.
  - Added repeatable drill structure and checklists to demonstrate process discipline.

- Home Lab Validation Environment
  - Built a Proxmox-based validation lab with Wazuh and Splunk components to test
    detection behavior before publishing artifacts.
  - Use lab runs to validate telemetry assumptions and improve signal quality.

ADDITIONAL
- Eligible to obtain clearance; willing to pursue sponsorship.
