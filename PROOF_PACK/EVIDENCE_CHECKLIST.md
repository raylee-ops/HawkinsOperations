## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### Don't Do This

```
❌ Screenshot showing: 192.168.1.105 (your actual network)
❌ Path showing: C:\Users\Raylee\Documents\...
❌ Alert showing: user "rhawkins" logged in
❌ Config showing: api_key = "sk-abc123..."
```

### Do This Instead

```
✅ Screenshot showing: 10.0.0.100 (or blur the IP)
✅ Path showing: C:\Users\analyst\Documents\...
✅ Alert showing: user "analyst01" logged in
✅ Config showing: api_key = "[REDACTED]"
```

## 🔍 Pre-Push Scan Commands

Run these BEFORE every `git push`:

```bash
# Scan for IP addresses
grep -r -E "([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}" --include="*.md" --include="*.xml" --include="*.yml"

# Scan for Windows paths with usernames
grep -r -E "C:\\\\Users\\\\" --include="*.md" --include="*.xml" --include="*.yml"

# Scan for secrets
grep -r -E "(password|api_key|token|secret)" --include="*.md" --include="*.xml" --include="*.yml"

# Scan for email addresses
grep -r -E "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}" --include="*.md"
```

**If ANY results appear: STOP. Review. Sanitize. Then push.**

## ✅ Final Review

Before publishing the Proof Pack:

- [ ] All screenshots sanitized
- [ ] All sample files sanitized
- [ ] All diagrams use generic/fake data
- [ ] Ran pre-push scan commands
- [ ] Reviewed results manually
- [ ] No personal identifiable information anywhere
