AS_OF_UTC: 2026-02-14T03:30:00Z
RUN_FOLDER: `PROOF_PACK/hosting_transfer_cloudflare/run_02-14-2026_031137/`

## Summary
- Objective: close Phase 3 hosting transfer execution evidence gates.
- Host under test: `https://hawkinsops.com`
- Validation lane: Cloudflare Pages production + preview/check metadata.

## Pass/Fail
- Deploy log completion (production + preview/check mapping): `PASS`
- Deterministic deploy evidence (3 consecutive main commits): `PASS`
- Route coverage (`/`, `/security`, `/projects`, `/resume`, `/proof`, `/lab`, `/triage`): `PASS`
- Unknown route custom 404 behavior: `PASS`
- `_headers` parity on production routes: `PASS`
- `_redirects` parity for resume canonicalization redirects: `PASS`
- Hard refresh parity (desktop + mobile no-cache checks): `PASS`
- DNS resolver checks (1.1.1.1 + 8.8.8.8): `PASS`
- DNS before->after backfill record: `PASS`
- Rollback drill receipt (controlled simulation): `PASS`

- All claims above are tied to explicit logs/screenshots in this run folder.
