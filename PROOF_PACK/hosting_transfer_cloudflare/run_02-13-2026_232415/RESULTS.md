## Notes
- Production evidence now includes immutable sanitized header and download logs committed under `evidence/logs/sanitized/`.
- iOS Safari lane is evidenced via iPhone Safari user-agent capture and mobile viewport artifacts from production URLs.
- Static redirect-map analysis still indicates no redirect loops for the two resume canonicalization rules in `site/_redirects`.
